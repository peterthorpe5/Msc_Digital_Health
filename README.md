# Coursework

The raw reads outputted from the sequencing Illumina MiSeq machine are here in 
``coursework_reads ``

The DNA was isolated from a pure culture. 

You can apply what you have learn to the following datasets:

Patient	reads	disease_cause?
Patient_007	patient_007_1.fastq.gz	?
Patient_007	patient_007_2.fastq.gz	?
Patient_A	patient_A_1.fastq.gz	?
Patient_A	patient_A_2.fastq.gz	?
Patient_B	patient_B_1.fastq.gz	?
Patient_B	patient_B_2.fastq.gz	?
Patient_WD40	patient_WD40_1.fastq.gz	?
Patient_WD40	patient_WD40_2.fastq.gz	?
